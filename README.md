# Custom html5 video player
In this challenge, i've managed to add some custom controls for an html5 video player, a start and pause button, a volume and speed sliders, two skip buttons, i've also made a progress bar that represents the video progress, and some other feature like fullscreen mode etc.. I've learned a lot of video properties and manipulation of unicode characters inside of javascript.
